# Front End Developer Coding Challenge

Hi there! Thank you for your interest in this role, and taking the time to undertake this coding challenge. 🙂 

## What we're looking for

We're interested to see how you would build the design included in this repo using HTML, CSS and Javascript, and in particular: 

- That you write clean, structured, semantic html.
- Your approach to writing, and knowledge of CSS, including the use of modern features where appropriate.
- You have a strong attention to detail and can replicate designs.
- You can deliver a sound responsive experience across all device sizes from the design provided.
- Your work demonstates efficiency and best practice, while keeping things simple where possible.

We don't want you to spend too much of your own time to complete this - provide whatever you feel can represent your current FE skill-set within a reasonable effort.

## Ways to approach this challenge

- The repo contains a file `data.json` in the `/assets/js/` subfolder. It contains all data for this page. You are free to use the framework of your choice and take a component-driven approach, or simply copy and paste as required into your markup.
- There is a carousel/gallery included in a section within the design. Please display the navigational arrows only on hover of the image and set to autoplay. You are not required to write the functionality and may select a plugin to use. 
- You may or may not have access to Sketch. A basic "UI Kit" is provided in lieu, together with an image of the design. We don't expect complete pixel perfect spacing between elements. Balance efficiency and precision.
- This challenge is set up to use [Parcel.js](https://parceljs.org/), which is a zero config application bundler. You aren't required to use this, please use whatever configuration (if at all) that you are comfortable with. If you have any issue with the set up please advise.

## Getting started

Please fork the repository to you personal Github account. After you have forked the repo, clone your forked version to your machine. 

Install the project dependencies:

`npm install`

Then start a local server:

`npm run dev`

## When completed

Please commit and push any work to your Github account and provide a link. 

If for any reason you cannot, or choose not to follow this process for any reason, please provide a compressed folder of your working files less any files and sub directories listed in the gitignore. 

Thanks, and good luck!
